=====
Part of the ZeroTier SDK

Securely connect application instances, physical devices, and virtual devices as if everything is on a single LAN. ZeroTier brings your network into user-space. No root, and no host configuration requirements.

We've paired our network hyper-visor core with a TCP/UDP/IP stack [(lwIP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LwIP) to provide your application with an exclusive and private virtual network layer. All traffic is end-to-end encrypted between each peer and we provide an easy-to-use socket interface similar to [System.Net.Sockets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.socket?view=net-5.0).
