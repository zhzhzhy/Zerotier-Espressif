 dist/  : Finished targets: libraries, binaries, packages, etc.
 cache/ : Build system caches that can safely be deleted after build.
 pkg/   : Project, script and spec files to generate packages.

1. git submodule update --init
2. (*)nix  : ./build.sh host "release"
2. Windows : . .\build.ps1; Build-Host -BuildType "Release" -Arch "x64"
