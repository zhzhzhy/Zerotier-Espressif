Use "./build.sh" to build the manual pages.

You'll need either NodeJS/npm installed (script will then automatically install the npm *marked-man* package) or */usr/bin/ronn*. The latter is a Ruby program packaged on some distributions as *rubygem-ronn* or *ruby-ronn* or installable as *gem install ronn*. The Node *marked-man* package and *ronn* from rubygems are two roughly equivalent alternatives for compiling MarkDown into roff/man format.
