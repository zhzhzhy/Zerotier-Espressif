     * 
     * <p>This is something you should "never" see, where "never" is defined as
     * once per 2^39 new node initializations / identity creations. If you do
     * see it, you're going to see it very soon after a node is first
     * initialized.</p>
     * 
     * <p>This is reported as an event rather than a return code since it's
     * detected asynchronously via error messages from authoritative nodes.</p>
     * 
     * <p>If this occurs, you must shut down and delete the node, delete the
     * identity.secret record/file from the data store, and restart to generate
     * a new identity. If you don't do this, you will not be able to communicate
     * with other nodes.</p>
     * 
     * <p>We'd automate this process, but we don't think silently deleting
     * private keys or changing our address without telling the calling code
     * is good form. It violates the principle of least surprise.</p>
     * 
     * <p>You can technically get away with not handling this, but we recommend
     * doing so in a mature reliable application. Besides, handling this
     * condition is a good way to make sure it never arises. It's like how
     * umbrellas prevent rain and smoke detectors prevent fires. They do, right?</p>
