ZeroTier Rules Compiler
======

This script converts ZeroTier rules in human-readable format into rules suitable for import into a ZeroTier network controller. It's the script that is used in the rules editor on [ZeroTier Central](https://my.zerotier.com/).

A command line interface is included that may be invoked as: `node cli.js <rules script>`.

See the [manual](https://www.zerotier.com/manual.shtml) for information about the rules engine and rules script syntax.
