/**
 * Rounds used for Salsa20 encryption in ZT
 *
 * Discussion:
 *
 * DJB (Salsa20's designer) designed Salsa20 with a significant margin of 20
 * rounds, but has said repeatedly that 12 is likely sufficient. So far (as of
 * July 2015) there are no published attacks against 12 rounds, let alone 20.
 *
 * In cryptography, a "break" means something different from what it means in
 * common discussion. If a cipher is 256 bits strong and someone finds a way
 * to reduce key search to 254 bits, this constitutes a "break" in the academic
 * literature. 254 bits is still far beyond what can be leveraged to accomplish
 * a "break" as most people would understand it -- the actual decryption and
 * reading of traffic.
 *
 * Nevertheless, "attacks only get better" as cryptographers like to say. As
 * a result, they recommend not using anything that's shown any weakness even
 * if that weakness is so far only meaningful to academics. It may be a sign
 * of a deeper problem.
 *
 * So why choose a lower round count?
 *
 * Turns out the speed difference is nontrivial. On a Macbook Pro (Core i3) 20
 * rounds of SSE-optimized Salsa20 achieves ~508mb/sec/core, while 12 rounds
 * hits ~832mb/sec/core. ZeroTier is designed for multiple objectives:
 * security, simplicity, and performance. In this case a deference was made
 * for performance.
 *
 * Meta discussion:
 *
 * The cipher is not the thing you should be paranoid about.
 *
 * I'll qualify that. If the cipher is known to be weak, like RC4, or has a
 * key size that is too small, like DES, then yes you should worry about
 * the cipher.
 *
 * But if the cipher is strong and your adversary is anyone other than the
 * intelligence apparatus of a major superpower, you are fine in that
 * department.
 *
 * Go ahead. Search for the last ten vulnerabilities discovered in SSL. Not
 * a single one involved the breaking of a cipher. Now broaden your search.
 * Look for issues with SSH, IPSec, etc. The only cipher-related issues you
 * will find might involve the use of RC4 or MD5, algorithms with known
 * issues or small key/digest sizes. But even weak ciphers are difficult to
 * exploit in the real world -- you usually need a lot of data and a lot of
 * compute time. No, virtually EVERY security vulnerability you will find
 * involves a problem with the IMPLEMENTATION not with the cipher.
 *
 * A flaw in ZeroTier's protocol or code is incredibly, unbelievably
 * more likely than a flaw in Salsa20 or any other cipher or cryptographic
 * primitive it uses. We're talking odds of dying in a car wreck vs. odds of
 * being personally impacted on the head by a meteorite. Nobody without a
 * billion dollar budget is going to break into your network by actually
 * cracking Salsa20/12 (or even /8) in the field.
 *
 * So stop worrying about the cipher unless you are, say, the Kremlin and your
 * adversary is the NSA and the GCHQ. In that case... well that's above my
 * pay grade. I'll just say defense in depth.

 *   <[5] destination ZT address>
 *   <[5] source ZT address>
 *   <[1] flags/cipher/hops>
 *   <[8] 64-bit MAC (or trusted path ID in trusted path mode)>

 *
 * Packets smaller than 28 bytes are invalid and silently discarded.
 *
 * The 64-bit packet ID is a strongly random value used as a crypto IV.
 * Its least significant 3 bits are also used as a monotonically increasing
 * (and looping) counter for sending packets to a particular recipient. This
 * can be used for link quality monitoring and reporting and has no crypto
 * impact as it does not increase the likelihood of an IV collision. (The
 * crypto we use is not sensitive to the nature of the IV, only that it does
 * not repeat.)
 *
 * The flags/cipher/hops bit field is: FFCCCHHH where C is a 3-bit cipher
 * selection allowing up to 7 cipher suites, F is outside-envelope flags,
 * and H is hop count.
 *
 * The three-bit hop count is the only part of a packet that is mutable in
 * transit without invalidating the MAC. All other bits in the packet are
 * immutable. This is because intermediate nodes can increment the hop
 * count up to 7 (protocol max).
 *
 * For unencrypted packets, MAC is computed on plaintext. Only HELLO is ever
 * sent in the clear, as it's the "here is my public key" message.
