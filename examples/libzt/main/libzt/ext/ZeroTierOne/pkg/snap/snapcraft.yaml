  ZeroTier is a software-based managed Ethernet switch for planet Earth. Use it to connect your
  desktop clients, servers, phones, NAS, or even individual applications (using our SDK).

  This snap contains ZeroTier One, a service that provides ZeroTier network connectivity and
  makes joining virtual networks as easy as joining IRC or Slack channels. Apps for Android
  and iOS are available for free in the Google Play and Apple app stores.

  ZeroTier eliminates the LAN/WAN distinction and makes VPNs, tunnels, proxies, and other kludges
  arising from the inflexible nature of physical networks obsolete. Everything is encrypted
  end-to-end and traffic takes the most direct (peer to peer) path available.

  Install (be sure to use sudo)

    sudo snap install zerotier

  Join your network

    sudo zerotier join <nwid>
    sudo zerotier status
