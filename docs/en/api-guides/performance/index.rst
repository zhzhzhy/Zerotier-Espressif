Performance
===========

ESP-IDF ships with default settings that are designed for a trade-off between performance, resource usage, and available functionality.

These guides describe how to optimize a firmware application for a particular aspect of performance. Usually this involves some trade-off in terms of limiting available functions, or swapping one aspect of performance (such as execution speed) for another (such as RAM usage).

How to Optimize Performance
---------------------------

1. Decide what the performance-critical aspects of your application are (for example: a particular response time to a certain network operation, a particular startup time limit, particular peripheral data throughput, etc.).
2. Find a way to measure this performance (some methods are outlined in the guides below).
3. Modify the code and project configuration and compare the new measurement to the old measurement.
4. Repeat step 3 until the performance meets the requirements set out in step 1.
